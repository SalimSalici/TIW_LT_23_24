### Overview
This web application allows users to manage work groups. It supports user registration, login, and group management functionalities, including:

- Creating new groups with configurable size (min and max participants)
- Inviting other users to join groups
- Viewing group details, such as participants
- Managing group membership (add, remove participants)

As per project requiremente, two versions of the same application have been developed:

**Pure HTML version:** A traditional multi-page application with full page reloads.

**JavaScript/RIA version:** A rich client-server single-page application (SPA) with asynchronous updates.
